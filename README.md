### Chest X-ray Image Classification using Deep Learning

#### Project Overview:
In this project, the goal was to classify Chest X-ray images into categories (likely Normal vs Pneumonia or other diseases) using deep learning techniques. The dataset used is the Chest X-ray dataset, which contains labeled X-ray images of patients' chests.

### Steps Taken in the Project:

1. Dataset Overview:
   - The Chest X-ray dataset consists of medical images of human chests, primarily focusing on detecting conditions like pneumonia or other chest-related diseases. The images are typically in grayscale and contain different types of lung diseases that need to be classified into predefined categories.

2. Image Preprocessing:
   - To handle large datasets and save memory, I used the ImageDataGenerator class from Keras, which allows for on-the-fly image augmentation. The following parameters were used:
     - rescale: 1.0 / 255.0 – This rescales the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.
     - shear_range: 0.1 – Allows for shearing transformations (skewing the image).
     - zoom_range: 0.2 – Random zooming of images.
     - rotation_range: 30 – Random rotations by up to 30 degrees.
     - width_shift_range and height_shift_range: 0.2 – Random horizontal and vertical shifting.
     - fill_mode: 'nearest' – Defines the strategy for filling pixels after transformation.
     - horizontal_flip: True – Enables random horizontal flips.
     - vertical_flip: True – Enables random vertical flips.

3. Image Reading and Augmentation:
   - The images were loaded with a target size of 500x500 and a batch size of 40. The color mode was set to grayscale to match the X-ray images, which are in black and white.
   - ImageDataGenerator was used to apply these transformations during the training and testing process to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

4. Building the Model:
   - I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the X-ray images. The model included several layers:
     - Convolutional Layers (Conv2D): To detect patterns and features in the X-ray images.
     - MaxPooling Layers: To reduce the spatial dimensions after convolutions.
     - Dropout: To prevent overfitting by randomly disabling some neurons during training.
     - Fully Connected Layers (Dense): For classification at the end of the model.
   - Activation Functions: I used ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) for intermediate layers and Sigmoid activation function for the final output layer since the task was binary classification.

5. Compiling the Model:
   - I compiled the model with binary_crossentropy loss function (suitable for binary classification) and Adam optimizer.
   - Callbacks were used to improve training and prevent overfitting:
     - EarlyStopping: Monitored the validation loss and stopped training if it didn’t improve for 4 consecutive epochs to avoid overfitting.
     - ReduceLROnPlateau: Reduced the learning rate if the validation loss did not improve for 3 epochs, helping the model to converge better.
     - ModelCheckpoint: Saved the model whenever the validation loss improved, storing the best model as best_xray_model.

6. Training the Model:
   - The model was trained on the training data and validated on the test data. The model achieved 90% accuracy on the training set and 87% accuracy on the test set, indicating good generalization to new, unseen images.

7. Model Evaluation:
   - After training, I visualized the loss and accuracy curves over the epochs for both training and validation data.
     - Training Loss and Validation Loss were plotted to ensure the model was learning properly.
     - Training Accuracy and Validation Accuracy were plotted to see how well the model was generalizing during training.

8. Prediction:
   - After training the model, I tested the final model on new images (both from the internet and from the dataset) to evaluate its prediction performance.
   - The model predicted the categories correctly for all the test images, showing its effectiveness in classifying chest X-ray images.

9. Saving the Model:
   - The final trained model was saved with the name best_xray_model for future use.

### Conclusion:

In this project, I successfully built a deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images, specifically for detecting pneumonia or other chest diseases. The model achieved 90% accuracy on the training data and 87% accuracy on the test data, demonstrating its ability to generalize well on unseen data. The ImageDataGenerator technique was particularly useful in augmenting the data, improving model robustness and preventing overfitting. The final model, best_xray_model, can be used to predict the class of new chest X-ray images.
